<b>	The Bar's Widgets</b><br/><br/>
This element allows you to choose which Widgets will show as defaults on the user's bar. Note the the Widget element comes equipped with a Widget gallery from which the user can choose and change his/her widgets. 
If the "Disable Local Storage" check-box is not checked, then the user's changed will be stored localy and changes made to the Widget element defaults will NOT show to the user. Any changes made to the widgets themselves and/or to the gallery will always show.
